**Removing whitespace from strings**
TRIM([leading | trailing | both] [characters] from string)
**First parameter: [leading|trailing|both]
**Second parameter: [characters]
**Third parameter: from string
SELECT TRIM('  padded ');
**The LTRIM and RTRIM functions are analogous to TRIM but only remove characters from either the beginning or the end of the string but not both**
**The function LPAD appends a character or string to another string by a specified number of characters**
SELECT LPAD('padded', 10, '#');
**The RPAD function is analogous to LPAD but will pad the string with the characters to the right**
-- Concatenate the padded first_name and last_name 
SELECT 
	RPAD(first_name, LENGTH(first_name)+1) || last_name AS full_name
FROM customer;
-- Concatenate the first_name and last_name 
SELECT 
	first_name || LPAD(last_name, LENGTH(last_name)+1) AS full_name
FROM customer; 
-- Concatenate the first_name and last_name 
SELECT 
	RPAD(first_name, LENGTH(first_name)+1) 
    || RPAD(last_name, LENGTH(last_name)+2, ' <') 
    || RPAD(email, LENGTH(email)+1, '>') AS full_email
